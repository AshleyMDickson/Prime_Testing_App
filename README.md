# Prime Testing App

A playground app with which to try out some C++ development.

## TODO

1. Add recursion to list prime factors only.
2. Add functionality to enter 2 numbers and find primes between -- DONE, sort of.
3. Add a function to count the number of prime factors
4. Consider some GUI options.
5. Sort input numbers by 'primality', i.e. number of prime factors from `0` (most prime) to `max` (least prime).
6. Add twin-primes finder.
