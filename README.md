# Prime Testing App

A playground app with which to try out some C++ development.

## TODO

1. Add recursion to list prime factors only.
2. Add functionality to enter 2 numbers and find primes between
3. Add a function to count the number of prime factors
4. Consider some GUI options.

Also: Need to merge with C++ multi-file project template to expand functionality.
